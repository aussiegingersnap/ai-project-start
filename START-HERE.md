# START HERE: Your Smart Assistant Template

> *"Create faster and better with AI - no tech skills needed!"*

## What Is This Template?

This is a ready-to-use project setup that helps you:

1. **Create content faster** using AI help
2. **Keep your work consistent** across projects
3. **Stay organized** without complexity
4. **Use ready-made tools** for common tasks

It works by giving the Cursor AI clear instructions about how you want things done.

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### 1. Get Started

**For a New Project:**
- Download this template
- Rename the folder to your project name
- Open the folder using the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) app

**For Existing Work:**
- Copy the special settings folder (the one named `.cursor`) into your project
- The smart features will work right away

### 2. Set Your Personal Preferences (Optional)

Want the AI to always work with you in a certain way?

- Open Cursor Settings
- Look for "User Rules"
- Add your personal preferences

This tells the AI how you like to work, no matter which project you're on.

### 3. Start Creating!

Simply tell Cursor what you want to make:

**For Business & Creative Work:**
- "Create a marketing campaign outline"
- "Draft a project timeline"
- "Generate a weekly metrics report"
- "Design a customer feedback form"
- "Write a product description"

## Staying Organized

Start simple and organize as you go. Create folders only when you need them:

**When Writing Documents:**
- Create a `docs` folder for your guides and documentation
- Use clear file names like "marketing-plan-2024.md"

**When Working with Media:**
- Create an `assets` folder for images and videos
- Name files descriptively like "team-photo-june2024.jpg"

**When Making Templates:**
- Create a `templates` folder for reusable formats
- Name templates clearly like "weekly-report-template.md"

**When Keeping History:**
- Create an `archive` folder for old versions
- Move old files there instead of deleting them

## Tips for Success

1. **Be specific** - "Create a sales email for our new product" works better than "Write an email"
2. **Mention the type of work** - Say "This is for marketing" so the AI uses the right helpers
3. **Give feedback** - Tell the AI what you like or don't like about its suggestions
4. **Start simple** - Create folders only when you need them
5. **Stay tidy** - Move old files to archive instead of letting them pile up
