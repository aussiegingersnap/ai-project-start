# Content Directory

This is where you can store all your content that you create with AI assistance!

## Folders

- **images/** - Store images, diagrams, charts, or other visual content
- **templates/** - Store reusable templates for common content types

## How to Use This Directory

1. **Ask the AI to create content** - For example, "Create a blog post about healthy eating habits"
2. **Save your content** - Store the content in the appropriate folder
3. **Organize as needed** - Create additional folders for specific projects or content types

Remember, you can ask the AI to help you organize and manage your content too!
