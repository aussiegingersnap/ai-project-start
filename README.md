# Simple Project Template with Cursor Project Rules

> *"Because every project deserves clear instructions for AI - even if you're not a coding wizard."*

This project template follows the Cursor Project Rules structure, providing a modern approach to guiding AI assistants in your workflow. **Designed to be simple and approachable, even for non-developers!**

## What are Cursor Project Rules?

Cursor Project Rules are modular `.mdc` files stored in the `.cursor/rules/` directory. This approach provides:

- **Easier AI guidance**: Tell AI exactly what you want
- **Better AI responses**: Get more accurate help
- **Simple management**: Update rules independently
- **Expandable**: Add more rules as needed

## Simple Directory Structure

```

```

## Getting Started (Super Simple)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Look at the rules in `.cursor/rules/` to understand what they do
3. Start using Cursor AI with intelligent assistance!

## How to Use Cursor Project Rules

### For Project Users

1. Open the project in Cursor
2. Tell the AI what you want to create
3. Let the AI assist you following the rules

### For Project Owners

1. Modify rules to match your needs
2. Add specific instructions as needed
3. Keep rules updated as your project evolves

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Consistent results**: The AI follows your guidelines
- **Faster work**: No need to repeat instructions
- **Better AI help**: Get more relevant and accurate suggestions
- **Reduced frustration**: Prevent AI from going off-track
