## Infrastructure Rules

> *"Infrastructure is code, and code is infrastructure - treat both with equal respect."*

### Deployment Process

- Implement CI/CD pipelines for all deployments
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC) for all resources
- Maintain separate environments for development, staging, and production
- Implement blue/green or canary deployments for zero downtime
- Automate rollback procedures for failed deployments
- Version infrastructure changes
- Test deployment processes regularly

### Environment Configuration

- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Store secrets in secure vaults, never in code
- Implement configuration validation on startup
- Document all configuration options
- Use sensible defaults when possible
- Keep environment parity between dev and production
- Implement separate config for each environment

### Scaling Strategy

- Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
- Implement auto-scaling based on appropriate metrics
- Use load balancers to distribute traffic
- Optimize resource utilization
- Implement database read replicas where appropriate
- Consider serverless for variable workloads
- Plan capacity based on growth projections

### Monitoring & Logging

- Implement comprehensive logging throughout the application
- Use structured logging format
- Centralize logs for easy searching and analysis
- Set up alerts for critical errors and performance issues
- Monitor system health metrics
- Implement distributed tracing for complex systems
- Create dashboards for key performance indicators

### Security Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege for all resources
- Implement network security groups and firewall rules
- Regularly update and patch all dependencies
- Scan infrastructure for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Use multi-factor authentication for infrastructure access
- Regularly rotate credentials and access keys
