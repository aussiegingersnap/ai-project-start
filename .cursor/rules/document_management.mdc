> *"The best organization is the simplest one that works."*

### Core Principles

- Create folders only when you have content to put in them
- Start with flat organization, add structure only when needed
- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate content
- Keep active documents at the root until patterns emerge
- Move to folders when you have 3+ related documents
- Archive old versions instead of deleting them

### File Naming

- Follow consistent naming: [Type]_[Topic]_[YYYYMMDD]
- Use descriptive names that indicate content
- Avoid special characters and spaces
- Include version numbers for evolving documents
- Keep names under 50 characters
- Use hyphens for spaces: marketing-plan-2024.md

### Common Folders

Create these only when you need them:

- `docs/` - For documentation (3+ guide documents)
- `assets/` - For media files (5+ images/videos)
- `templates/` - For reusable formats (2+ templates)
- `archive/` - For old versions (any outdated files)

### Version Management

- Start simple: v1, v2, v3 in file names
- Move to semantic versioning (v1.0.1) only if needed
- Keep the latest version in the working directory
- Move older versions to archive
- Document major changes in file headers
- Use comments to explain significant updates

### Document Standards

- Start with simple markdown files
- Add formatting standards when patterns emerge
- Create templates after writing 2+ similar documents
- Keep templates minimal and focused
- Include examples in templates
- Document any required sections
- Include license and copyright notice in all substantial documents

### Licensing Requirements

- All substantial documents must include the Adelaide Group copyright notice
- Include reference to LICENSE.md in project root
- Maintain clear attribution requirements in derivative works
- Document any third-party licenses used
- Track commercial usage and revenue limits

### Security Basics

- Back up important files regularly
- Use standard sharing permissions
- Mark sensitive content clearly
- Keep access logs for important documents
- Remove old permissions when archiving

### Best Practices

- Don't create folders until you need them
- Keep similar files together
- Use consistent naming within categories
- Archive regularly to reduce clutter
- Document decisions that affect organization
- Review and clean up monthly
