## Backend Development Rules

> *"Building backends without rules is like constructing a house with duct tape and good intentions."*

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles for endpoint design
- Use consistent URL patterns: `/api/v1/resource`
- Implement proper HTTP status codes for all responses
- Return detailed error messages in development, generic ones in production
- Version your APIs to maintain backward compatibility

### Data Management

- Use ORMs or query builders rather than raw SQL when possible
- Follow database normalization principles (avoid duplication)
- Include database migrations for all schema changes
- Implement proper indexing for frequently queried fields
- Use transactions for operations affecting multiple records

### Security Practices

- NEVER store sensitive data in plain text (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- Implement proper input validation on ALL user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Set appropriate security headers for all responses
- Rate limit endpoints to prevent abuse

### Performance

- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Use pagination for endpoints returning large datasets
- Optimize database queries (avoid N+1 problems)
- Log performance metrics for critical operations
- Consider background processing for time-consuming tasks

### Error Handling

- Implement global error handling middleware
- Log all errors with appropriate context
- Never expose stack traces in production
- Use structured logging format
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
