# How User Rules and Project Rules Work Together

> *"Think of it like this: Project Rules are for the specific project, User Rules are about how YOU want to be helped across ALL projects!"*

## Understanding the Difference

**Cursor Project Rules** (.cursor/rules/*.mdc files):
- Apply to the specific project they're in
- Focus on project-specific guidelines
- Live in the project folders
- Are shared with anyone who uses the project

**User Rules** (in Cursor settings):
- Apply to all your interactions with Cursor AI
- Focus on your personal preferences
- Live in your Cursor application settings
- Are private to you

## How They Complement Each Other

When you use both User Rules and Project Rules together, you get the best of both worlds:

1. **Project Rules** ensure the AI understands the specific needs of your current project
2. **User Rules** ensure the AI communicates and works with you in your preferred style

It's like having both a project manager (Project Rules) and a personal assistant (User Rules) working together to help you!

## Example Scenario

Imagine you're working on a blog post:

- **Project Rules** tell the AI about the content structure, formatting guidelines, and where to save files
- **User Rules** tell the AI how detailed you want explanations, how you prefer to receive feedback, and your personal communication style

## Setting Up Your User Rules

1. Go to the `docs/cursor-user-rules.md` file in this project
2. Copy the content provided
3. Open Cursor Settings
4. Navigate to the User Rules section
5. Paste the content and adjust as needed to reflect your preferences

## Customizing Your User Rules

Feel free to modify the User Rules to better match your preferences:

- Change the communication style (more formal/casual)
- Adjust the level of detail you prefer in explanations
- Specify topics you're interested in or knowledgeable about
- Add instructions for how you prefer to receive information

## Best Practices

- Keep your User Rules concise and focused on what matters most to you
- Update it as you learn what works best for your workflow
- Don't duplicate guidelines that are already in Project Rules
- Use specific examples to clarify your preferences

*Remember: The perfect setup combines the structure of Project Rules with the personalization of User Rules!*
