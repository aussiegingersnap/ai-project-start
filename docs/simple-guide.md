# Simple Guide to Your AI Project

> *"AI doesn't have to be complicated. Here's how to use this template with zero coding required!"*

## What's In This Project?

This project is set up to help you work with AI effectively, even if you're not a developer. Here's what's included:

### 1. Rules for the AI (.cursor/rules/)
Special instructions that tell the AI how to help you. You don't need to modify these unless you want to customize how the AI behaves.

### 2. Content Folder (content/)
A place to store everything you create with AI assistance:
- **documents/** - For text documents, reports, etc.
- **images/** - For images and visual content
- **templates/** - Pre-made templates to help you get started

### 3. Documentation (docs/)
Helpful guides like this one to explain how everything works.

### 4. Configuration (config/)
Technical settings that you probably won't need to touch.

## Getting Started in 3 Easy Steps

### Step 1: Open in Cursor
Open this folder in the Cursor app (which uses AI to help you create content).

### Step 2: Start a Conversation
Click on the chat icon and ask the AI for help with anything you need. For example:
- "Help me write a blog post about mindfulness"
- "Create a weekly meal plan template for my family"
- "Draft an email to my team about our upcoming event"

### Step 3: Save Your Work
When you're happy with what the AI has created, save it to the appropriate folder in the `content` directory.

## Example Prompts to Try

Here are some examples of things you can ask the AI to create:
- "Write a product description for a new eco-friendly water bottle"
- "Create a weekly social media content calendar template"
- "Help me draft a professional bio for my LinkedIn profile"
- "Write a letter to my landlord about maintenance issues"

## Tips for Working with AI

1. **Be specific** - The more details you provide, the better the results
2. **Give feedback** - Tell the AI what you like or don't like about its suggestions
3. **Iterate** - Don't expect perfection on the first try; refine through conversation
4. **Save versions** - Keep different versions of your content as you refine it
5. **Have fun** - Experiment and try new things!
