# Getting Started with Cursor Project Rules

> *"It's as simple as telling your AI assistant what you want - no coding degree required!"*

## Super Simple Start Guide

### 1. Get the Template

**Option A: Download (Easy):**
- Download this repository as a ZIP file
- Extract it to a folder on your computer
- Rename the folder to your project name

**Option B: Clone (For GitHub Users):**
```bash
# Create a new project based on this template
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-template.git my-project
cd my-project
```

### 2. Open in Cursor

- Download and install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) if you don't have it
- Open Cursor
- Use File > Open Folder... to open your project folder

### 3. Start Using AI Assistance

Simply tell Cursor what you want to create! For example:
- "Create a simple landing page"
- "Help me write a blog post"
- "Draft an email template"

The AI will follow the rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory automatically!

## What Are These Rule Files?

In the `.cursor/rules/` folder, you'll find:

- **general.mdc**: Basic rules for the AI to follow
- **frontend.mdc**: Rules for creating websites/interfaces
- **backend.mdc**: Rules for creating server/database code
- **agent_instructions.mdc**: How the AI should behave

You don't need to understand all the technical details! The rules are already set up to help the AI assist you better.

## Customizing Rules (When You're Ready)

When you feel comfortable, you can start customizing:

1. Open any `.mdc` file in the `.cursor/rules/` folder
2. Edit the text to change instructions
3. Save the file
4. The AI will now follow your updated rules

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:

1. Ask the Cursor AI for help ("How do I use these project rules?")
2. Visit the [Cursor documentation](https://cursor.sh/docs)
3. Join the [Cursor Discord community](https://discord.gg/cursor)

*Remember: You don't need to be a developer to use this template. The AI is here to help you create, even if you don't know how to code!*
